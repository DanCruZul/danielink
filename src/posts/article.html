      How Can Designers Prepare for the Future?

    <p>
      Last month, I had the chance to attend CSS Day in Amsterdam, a two day
      event split between a "UI day" focusing on the intersection of design and
      development and a "CSS day", with speakers who covered more in-depth,
      technical CSS subjects. The talks were as diverse as the background of the
      speakers themselves, but there was one common thread: In this era of rapid
      change, are we, as product people, equipped to design for automation,
      machine learning, and AI?
    </p>
    <h3 class="text-h3 font-medium">
      What does automation mean for designers?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It's hard to work on a product team that hasn't automated some part of
      their workflow in the name of productivity. If machines can take care of
      the repeatable tasks and heavy lifting, designers can focus on doing more
      meaningful work. But how does this affect the way we use the work being
      created by machines?
    </p>
    <p>
      Josh Clark, founder of design studio Big Medium, provoked the audience
      with this very question during his talk, 'A.I. is your New Design
      Material'. Some of the most impressive advancements in recent technology
      are things like facial recognition, predictive text, and image search, all
      powered by machine learning. But it's important to rememberâ€”all of these
      technologies are still built on code. The upside is less room for error.
      No real emotions, expectations, or feelings get in the way of the job it
      was designed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as humans, we assume that when facial recognition fails, the whole
      process is inherently flawed. But was it really?
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Josh, that is the most fundamental thing to understand when
      it comes to machines. Not meeting our human expectations, doesn't
      automatically make the technology itself a failure. These things were, by
      definition, built on logic, which begs the question: Can a robot's
      solution actually be wrong?
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of introducing machine learning into our products was never to
      have them do all the work. Instead, algorithms and logic-based solutions
      ought only provide humans with better insight so as to empower us to
      arrive at better solutions, faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fundamental understanding our users that really helps us make better
      products. This might be a simple example, but if a computer can figure out
      how to walk on it's own, maybe it's time to start investigating why and
      how these solutions were formed.
